# Project Instructions for Claude

## Git Workflow

**IMPORTANT**: Always create a git commit after making any file changes. This includes:
- Creating new files
- Editing existing files
- Deleting files
- Any other modifications to the codebase

After completing any file operation, immediately commit the changes with a descriptive commit message that explains what was changed and why.

Follow the standard git commit workflow:
1. Stage the changed files with `git add`
2. Create a commit with a clear, concise message
